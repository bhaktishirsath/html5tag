<p>Example of aside element </p>

  <h4>The aside element</h4>
  <p>My definition of the aside element would be "information either unrelated or loosely related to the main content of a page should go in aside tags" â€“ however, that is not W3C's definition. They write: "The aside element represents content that is tangentially related to the content that forms the main textual flow of a document."</p>
